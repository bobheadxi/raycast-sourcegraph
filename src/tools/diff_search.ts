/**
 * Search through code changes and diffs in your private Sourcegraph instance.
 * This tool searches the actual content of code modifications, additions, and deletions
 * across your git history, with powerful filtering by author, time, file type, and more.
 *
 * WHEN TO USE:
 * - Find when specific code patterns were introduced or removed
 * - Track the evolution of particular functions or features
 * - Investigate bug introduction or fix implementation
 * - Find examples of how certain refactoring was done
 * - Analyze code changes by specific developers or time periods
 *
 * EXAMPLES:
 * - `handleAuth author:alice after:"1 month ago"` - Alice's auth changes
 * - `select:commit.diff.added import.*react file:\.tsx?$` - New React imports
 * - `deprecated AND -message:"remove deprecated"` - Deprecated code additions
 * - `/function.*Handler/ repo:myorg/api` - Handler function changes in API
