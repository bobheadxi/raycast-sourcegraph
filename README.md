# Raycast extension for Sourcegraph

This is an extension that enables searching [Sourcegraph, a code search engine](https://about.sourcegraph.com/code-search), directly within [Raycast, an extendible launcher for MacOS](https://www.raycast.com/).

## Installation

> This extension is incomplete, and therefore not yet published to the [Raycast store](https://www.raycast.com/store).

Clone this repository and use the ["Import Extension" command in Raycast](https://developers.raycast.com/basics/import-an-extension#import-the-extension) to point to your clone of this repository. In this repository, then run:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

The "Search Sourcegraph" command should now be available within Raycast.
